# CNOT_Benchmarking - RB for CX Gates

# Description:
This is one of the deliverables for the project #14 QEC fidelity for cx gates of QAMP Spring 2022 (https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-spring-22/issues/14). Here, you will find work done and some tools that were used along the project to run experiments to see how randomized benchmarking and QEC can be used together. Other point that we investigated here, was the Error per Clifford (EPC) values using the existing RBFitter functions and with that we are trying to create a new QEC-inspired measure of fidelity that can be calculated from theoretically derived or experimentally measured.
